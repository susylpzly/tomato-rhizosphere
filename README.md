__Abstract__ <br>
Strigolactones are plant hormones involved in the interaction of plant roots with the rhizosphere microbiome, influencing plant growth and development. Their biosynthesis and secretion are upregulated under phosphate starvation conditions since they play a role in the recruitment of beneficial microorganisms to ease the stress of the condition (Zhang et al. 2015). Shotgun metagenome sequencing data was obtained from tomato rhizosphere under phosphate starvation, where the plantsâ€™ expression of hormone-synthetizing enzymes was altered through VIGS, targeting genes in the strigolactone biosynthesis gene cluster. The targeted genes include P450 CYP712, P450 CYP722C, and CCD8, which result in concentration fluxes of the various strigolactone products. This is relevant to investigate the effect of tomato strigolactones on the microbial communities of the rhizosphere and in return their functional potential to impact the plant. The latter accomplished by secondary metabolite BGC analysis through antiSMASH6 (Blin et al. 2021). Data processing was performed through the IMP3 pipeline (Narayanasamy et al. 2016) to obtain contigs from de novo assembly, to annotate and
count mapped read counts, followed by statistical analyses between the treatment lines of the functional profiles built from the counts. The analysis methods revealed that the CYP712 silenced line results in the most differential abundant KOs from the KEGG annotation. The main differential abundance methods used were DESeq2, MaAslin2, and ANCOM2, which revealed an overlap of some annotated KOs and CAZymes which were mostly involved in energy metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotide sugars, and cofactors for the former, and depolymerization and recycling cell wall polysaccharides for the latter (Amengual et al. 2022). Finally for the potential BGCs in the microbiome, antiSMASH6 results indicated the differential presence of siderophore and betalactone types of clusters, which are involved in iron transport into the cell for growth and survival (Saha et al. 2016), and regulation of root development and phosphate intake, respectively. Further research to understand the effect of the microbial diversity change in the plant could include treatment of bulk-soil with the strigolactones involved in the observed differences, in this case Orobanchol.
